## Project Description

Electro AI Assistant is a real-time AI-powered video assistant designed for beginner electronics students. It analyzes hardware circuits through a live camera feed and provides instant voice-based explanations and corrections.


## The Problem statement

Beginner electronics students struggle to understand circuit connections and often waste time describing their setup to AI tools. They need instant visual assistance while building hardware projects.

## The Solution

Electro AI Assistant watches the user's circuit through a camera and provides real-time, voice-based explanations and wiring corrections, eliminating the need for manual descriptions.
